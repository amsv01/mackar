# macKar

> Self macOS configure for developers

**TL;DR:** 

Tired of reconfiguring your macOS, this is my solution!

**Long version**

As a consultant or a person or move to new device in short period of time, you want to have a full and quick automatic configuration for your macOS to save your time and make your life easier. Here I create a repo with all tool that I found useful and cool for developers in all these years.

Why do I call it macKar? In Persian if you add "Kar" postfix to a word means a person who use or good in working with that. "mac-kar" Basically means macOS user. Pretty cool mix of English and Persian, hah?
