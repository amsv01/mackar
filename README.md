# macKar

> Self macOS configure for developers

**TL;DR:**

Tired of reconfiguring your macOS, this is my solution!

**Long version**

As a consultant or a person or move to new device in short period, you want to have a full and quick automatic configuration for your macOS to save your time and make your life easier. Here I create a repo with all tool that I found useful and cool for developers in all these years.

Why do I call it macKar? In Persian if you add "Kar" postfix to a word means a person who use or good in working with that. In the same time "mak-kar" is an adjective in Persian which means cunning. Pretty cool mix of English and Persian, hah?

1. Create a file inside of installers directory and call it `<app_name>.sh`.
2. Create a function in that file by this naming convention `install_<app_name>`.
3. Add all installing formula under that function
4. Run the script again. :)
